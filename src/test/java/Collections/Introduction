Collections Framework is a framework used to store and manipulate groups of objects efficiently.

Operations available in the Collections Framework include:

Searching: Searching for an element in the collection.
Insertion: Adding an element to the collection.
Manipulation: Modifying elements in the collection.
Deletion: Removing elements from the collection.
Sorting: Arranging the elements in a specific order.
Interfaces in the Collections Framework:

Set: Represents a collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
List: Represents an ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.
Queue: Represents a collection that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
Deque: Represents a collection that allows insertion and removal of elements at both ends.
Classes in the Collections Framework:

ArrayList: Implements the List interface and provides a resizable array-based implementation.
Vector: Similar to ArrayList, but it is synchronized (thread-safe).
LinkedList: Implements the List interface and provides a doubly-linked list implementation.
HashSet: Implements the Set interface and uses a hash table for storage, allowing fast access.
TreeSet: Implements the Set interface and stores elements in a sorted tree structure.
PriorityQueue: Implements the Queue interface and stores elements based on priority.
Deque: Represents a double-ended queue and can be implemented using various classes like ArrayDeque or LinkedList.
